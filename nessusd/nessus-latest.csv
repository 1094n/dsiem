    in the date parsing routines to properly check string
    ends. A remote attacker can exploit this to cause a

vulnerabilities :

  - A use-after-free error exists related to function
    'unserialize', which can allow a remote attacker to
    execute arbitrary code. Note that this issue is due to
    an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8142. (CVE-2015-0231)

  - An integer overflow error exists in function 'regcomp'
    in the Henry Spencer regex library, due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An attacker can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-2305)

  - An integer overflow error exists in the '_zip_cdir_new'
    function, due to improper validation of user-supplied
    input. An attacker, using a crafted ZIP archive, can
    exploit this to cause a denial of service or to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-2331)

  - A filter bypass vulnerability exists due to a flaw in
    the move_uploaded_file() function in which pathnames are
    truncated when a NULL byte is encountered. This allows a
    remote attacker, via a crafted second argument, to
    bypass intended extension restrictions and create files
    with unexpected names. (CVE-2015-2348)

  - A user-after-free error exists in the

    exploit these errors to execute arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2015-6834)

  - A use-after-free memory error exists related to the
    php_var_unserialize() function. A remote attacker, using
    a crafted serialize string, can exploit this to execute
    arbitrary code. (CVE-2015-6835)

  - A type confusion error exists related to the
    serialize_function_call() function due to improper
    validation of the headers field. A remote attacker can
    exploit this to have unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-6836)

  - Multiple flaws exist in the XSLTProcessor class due to
    improper validation of input from the libxslt library. A
    remote attacker can exploit thse flaws to have an
    unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-6837, CVE-2015-6838)

  - A flaw exists in the php_zip_extract_file() function
    in file php_zip.c due to improper sanitization of

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.
